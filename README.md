Not all the needed pickle files are present since github doesn't allow uploads above 25MB.

To run the ontonotes.py file, the ontonotes corpus is needed. 

The correct order to run the files for the complete algorithm is:
> 1. ontonotes.py
> 2. nounphrases.py
> 3. algorithm.py
> 4. new_features.py
> 5. MLA_compare.py
